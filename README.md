# Text-Summariser-NLP

The project aims to develop a text summarizer using natural language processing techniques with an extractive approach. The summarizer will analyze a given text and identify the most important sentences based on their relevance to the overall content. The system will use techniques such as sentence parsing, keyword extraction, and scoring algorithms to rank and select the most informative sentences. The resulting summary will provide a concise and coherent representation of the original text, enabling users to quickly grasp the main points without having to read the entire document. This project has the potential to assist in various fields such as news agencies, researchers, and businesses to quickly extract the most significant information from large texts.
