# Text-Summariser-NLP

The project aims to develop a text summarizer using natural language processing techniques with an extractive approach. The summarizer will analyze a given text and identify the most important sentences based on their relevance to the overall content. The system will use techniques such as sentence parsing, keyword extraction, and scoring algorithms to rank and select the most informative sentences. The resulting summary will provide a concise and coherent representation of the original text, enabling users to quickly grasp the main points without having to read the entire document. This project has the potential to assist in various fields such as news agencies, researchers, and businesses to quickly extract the most significant information from large texts.

## Architecture
//Diagrams with canva showing various processes of NLP used eg: Preprocessing->Stemming->Lemmatisation,
  Mathematics involved ie maybe wordvectors used and the theory behind them.

## Dataset used
The dataset used is an article of around 5000 words, obtained from Wikipedia, in .txt format that is uploaded in the session storage of the colab notebook for it to be read by the model.

## Performance and Results
The model summarises a dataset containing around 5000 words to produce an accurate summary of 340 words.

The current model that we have presented is based on word and sentence frequency along with considering the presence of stopwords. It could further be improvised by incorporating the concept of word embeddings, where the meaning of the word is given better importance.
